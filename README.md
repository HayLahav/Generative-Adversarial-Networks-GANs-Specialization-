# Generative-Adversarial-Networks-GANs-Specialization-
A Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Specialization made by deeplearning.ai on Coursera

The Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Specialization offered by deeplearning.ai on Coursera is a comprehensive series of courses designed to provide learners with a deep understanding of Generative Adversarial Networks, a revolutionary class of machine learning models. The specialization consists of four courses, each focusing on different aspects of GANs:

Course 1: Build Basic Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
This course introduces you to the fundamentals of GANs. You'll learn about the core concepts of GANs, including how they work and the adversarial training process. The course covers building basic GANs and DCGANs (Deep Convolutional GANs) to generate images.

Course 2: Build Better Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
In this course, you'll delve deeper into GANs by exploring techniques to improve their stability and generate high-quality samples. You'll learn about techniques such as Wasserstein GANs, Conditional GANs, and how to evaluate GAN performance.

Course 3: Apply Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
The third course focuses on applying GANs to real-world problems. You'll learn how to generate images, create art, and even create new styles for existing images using GANs. The course also covers advanced topics like text-to-image synthesis.

Course 4: Deep Generative Image Models Using TensorFlow
This course explores advanced topics related to generative models. You'll learn about Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and how they differ from GANs. The course also covers topics like semi-supervised learning and generating high-resolution images.

Throughout the specialization, you'll gain hands-on experience by implementing GANs using popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow. The courses are structured with video lectures, quizzes, and programming assignments that guide you through the theory and practical aspects of GANs.

By the end of the specialization, you'll have a strong foundation in GANs and the ability to generate realistic images, art, and even text using these powerful generative models. It's a well-structured and comprehensive program for anyone interested in diving into the world of GANs and generative modeling.
