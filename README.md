# Generative-Adversarial-Networks-GANs-Specialization-
A Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Specialization made by deeplearning.ai on Coursera

As a student who completed the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) Specialization by deeplearning.ai on Coursera, I've gained a comprehensive understanding of GANs and their applications. Throughout the specialization, I learned the following courses:

# Course 1: Build Basic Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
In this course, I learned the fundamental concepts of GANs. I grasped how GANs consist of a generator and a discriminator, engaged in a game where the generator tries to create realistic data while the discriminator aims to distinguish real from generated data. I became proficient in building simple GANs using TensorFlow and Keras, understanding loss functions, and training processes. This course laid the foundation for more complex GAN architectures and techniques.

Week 1: Introduction to GANs and Basics

Learned the concept of GANs and their architecture.

Understood the adversarial training process and how GANs learn to generate realistic data.

Week 2: Deep Convolutional GANs (DCGANs)

Studied the DCGAN architecture designed for image generation.
Learned about using convolutional layers and transposed convolutions in the generator and discriminator.
Explored advanced techniques like batch normalization and leaky ReLU.

# Course 2: Build Better Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
This course expanded on the basics learned previously. I delved into improved GAN architectures like DCGAN (Deep Convolutional GAN) and conditional GANs. I gained insights into techniques like batch normalization and learned about the challenges of training GANs, including mode collapse. Through hands-on assignments, I enhanced my ability to design and implement more advanced GAN models and understand their strengths and limitations.

* Learned about the progressive growth of GANs for generating high-resolution images.
  
# Course 3: Apply Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
In this course, I learned about using GANs for various applications beyond image generation. I explored how to generate art, music, and even textual content using GANs. Additionally, I gained an understanding of using GANs for data augmentation and image-to-image translation tasks. Through practical projects, I honed my skills in adapting GANs to different domains and creatively applying them to solve real-world problems.

Week 1: Art Generation

* Explored using GANs for generating art, including paintings and images with artistic styles.
* Learned about StyleGAN and neural style transfer.
  
Week 2: Music Generation

* Explored techniques like SeqGAN for sequence generation.
* 
Week 3: Text Generation and Data Augmentation

*Studied text generation using GANs and learned about techniques like SeqGAN.
*Explored using GANs for data augmentation in various domains.

# Course 4: Structured GANs
The final course focused on structured data and more advanced GAN techniques. I learned about conditional GANs for structured data, such as generating sequences and tabular data. The course introduced me to techniques like Wasserstein GANs, which address training stability issues, and the progressive growth of GANs for high-resolution image generation. Through challenging projects, I became proficient in applying GANs to a broader range of data types and gained insights into cutting-edge GAN advancements.
